### Story 1: Instrument Django Application with Prometheus
**Summary:** Instrument the Django application to expose metrics to Prometheus.

**Description:**
- Integrate Prometheus client library with the Django app.
- Expose key metrics such as request count, error rates, and response times.
- Ensure metrics endpoint is accessible for Prometheus scraping.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Prometheus client library is integrated with the Django app.
- Key metrics are exposed and accessible at a metrics endpoint.
- Prometheus can scrape metrics from the Django app successfully.
- Documentation on the metrics exposed and how to access them is provided.

### Story 2: Add Service Monitor Specifications to Deployment
**Summary:** Add Service Monitor specifications to the Django app deployment.

**Description:**
- Define ServiceMonitor resources for the Django app.
- Ensure the ServiceMonitor configuration aligns with Prometheus scraping requirements.
- Update the Kubernetes deployment configuration to include the ServiceMonitor.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ServiceMonitor resources are defined and applied.
- Prometheus is able to scrape metrics using the ServiceMonitor.
- Deployment configurations are updated and documented.

### Story 3: Create and Configure Prometheus Dashboard
**Summary:** Create and configure a Prometheus dashboard for the Django app.

**Description:**
- Set up a Prometheus dashboard to visualize key metrics from the Django app.
- Identify and display important metrics (e.g., request count, error rates, response times).
- Ensure the dashboard is easily accessible and provides meaningful insights.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A Prometheus dashboard is created and accessible.
- Key metrics from the Django app are displayed on the dashboard.
- Documentation on dashboard usage and key metrics interpretation is provided.

### Story 4: Set Up Alerts for Prometheus Metrics
**Summary:** Set up alerts based on Prometheus metrics for the Django app.

**Description:**
- Define alerting rules for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, performance degradation).
- Configure Prometheus to send alerts to the appropriate channels (e.g., email, Slack).
- Test the alerting system to ensure it works as expected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Alerting rules for key metrics are defined and configured.
- Alerts are sent to the specified channels and are actionable.
- Documentation on alert rules and alerting configuration is provided.
