### Story Title
**Create a Sample Flask App to Demonstrate Reading Secrets from a Volume**

### Description
As a developer, I want to create a sample Flask application that demonstrates the ability to securely read secrets (such as database credentials) from a mounted volume, ensuring sensitive information is managed securely and in compliance with our security policies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Flask Application Setup**: The Flask app should be set up with a basic route that attempts to connect to a MySQL database using credentials read from secrets stored in a volume.
2. **Secrets Management**: Secrets like database username, password, and hostname should be stored outside the application code, in a Kubernetes secret or Docker secret, and mounted into the Flask app container as a volume.
3. **Configuration**: The Flask app should be configurable to read the file path for secrets dynamically, allowing for flexibility in deployment environments.
4. **Logging**: Implement logging to confirm the successful reading of secrets without exposing them in logs.
5. **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation on how to set up the secrets, mount them to the Flask app container, and any necessary Kubernetes or Docker commands.
6. **Security Practices**: Ensure the implementation adheres to best practices for secret management, including restricted access to the secrets volume.
7. **Demo**: Prepare a demonstration setup that showcases the Flask app reading and using the secrets for a database connection, without actual database operations for simplicity.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement the Flask app with a focus on reading configuration from mounted volumes.
- [ ] Create Kubernetes or Docker secrets as per the deployment strategy.
- [ ] Configure volume mounts for the Flask app container to access the secrets.
- [ ] Add error handling and logging to capture and debug issues with secret reading.
- [ ] Document the setup process, including creating secrets, deploying the Flask app, and verifying its operation.
- [ ] Prepare a demo scenario to showcase the app's functionality.

### Notes
- Consider using Flask's `os.environ.get` method to read environment variables that point to the file paths of secrets.
- Review Kubernetes documentation on managing secrets and volume mounts if deploying in a Kubernetes environment.
- Ensure all team members involved in the deployment process have the necessary access rights to create and manage secrets.
