Got it. I'll adjust the first Jira story to focus solely on instrumenting the Django app with Prometheus.

---

### Story 1: Instrument Django Application with Prometheus
**Summary:** Instrument the Django application to expose metrics to Prometheus.

**Description:**
- Integrate Prometheus client library with the Django app.
- Expose key metrics such as request count, error rates, and response times.
- Ensure metrics endpoint is accessible for Prometheus scraping.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Prometheus client library is integrated with the Django app.
- Key metrics are exposed and accessible at a metrics endpoint.
- Prometheus can scrape metrics from the Django app successfully.
- Documentation on the metrics exposed and how to access them is provided.

---

### Story 2: Add Service Monitor Specifications to Deployment
**Summary:** Add Service Monitor specifications to the Django app deployment.

**Description:**
- Define ServiceMonitor resources for the Django app.
- Ensure the ServiceMonitor configuration aligns with Prometheus scraping requirements.
- Update the Kubernetes deployment configuration to include the ServiceMonitor.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ServiceMonitor resources are defined and applied.
- Prometheus is able to scrape metrics using the ServiceMonitor.
- Deployment configurations are updated and documented.

---

### Story 3: Create and Configure Prometheus Dashboard
**Summary:** Create and configure a Prometheus dashboard for the Django app.

**Description:**
- Set up a Prometheus dashboard to visualize key metrics from the Django app.
- Identify and display important metrics (e.g., request count, error rates, response times).
- Ensure the dashboard is easily accessible and provides meaningful insights.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A Prometheus dashboard is created and accessible.
- Key metrics from the Django app are displayed on the dashboard.
- Documentation on dashboard usage and key metrics interpretation is provided.

---

### Story 4: Set Up Alerts for Prometheus Metrics
**Summary:** Set up alerts based on Prometheus metrics for the Django app.

**Description:**
- Define alerting rules for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, performance degradation).
- Configure Prometheus to send alerts to the appropriate channels (e.g., email, Slack).
- Test the alerting system to ensure it works as expected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Alerting rules for key metrics are defined and configured.
- Alerts are sent to the specified channels and are actionable.
- Documentation on alert rules and alerting configuration is provided.

Certainly! Below is a template for a JIRA story that captures the task of integrating Splunk as an optional logging output for the Logging Operator Helm chart. This story will outline the necessary updates and additions to the Helm chart, including modifications to the values, templates, and documentation.

### Title:
Integrate Splunk Output Option in Logging Operator Helm Chart

### Description:
In order to provide enhanced logging capabilities and utilize Splunk for log analysis, we need to integrate Splunk as an optional output within our Logging Operator Helm chart. This integration will allow users to optionally forward logs to Splunk, leveraging Splunk's robust analytics and visualization features. The integration involves updating the Helm chart with new templates for Splunk output, modifying `values.yaml` to include Splunk-specific configurations, and ensuring that these changes are properly documented and validated.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Helm Chart Update**: The Helm chart should be updated to include a new output template for Splunk, which is conditionally applied based on a user-defined flag.
2. **Configuration Flexibility**: Users should be able to enable or disable Splunk output via the `values.yaml` file. When enabled, necessary configurations like host, port, and credentials should be customizable.
3. **Secrets Management**: The chart should correctly handle Splunk credentials through Kubernetes secrets to ensure security.
4. **Documentation**: Update the Helm chart documentation to include instructions on how to configure and enable Splunk output.
5. **Validation**: Include a JSON schema validation for new Splunk configuration parameters in `values.yaml`.
6. **Testing**: Demonstrate the functionality with tests that confirm logs are properly forwarded to Splunk when enabled.

### Task Breakdown:
- [ ] Update `values.yaml` to include parameters for Splunk output configuration.
- [ ] Create a new template file `splunk-output.yaml` for the Splunk output.
- [ ] Modify the flow template to conditionally include Splunk output references.
- [ ] Update the JSON schema to validate new Splunk configuration parameters.
- [ ] Update the Helm chart documentation to include detailed instructions on configuring Splunk output.
- [ ] Implement and document test cases to verify the integration works as expected.

### Title:
Secure Management and Deployment of Splunk HEC Token

### Description:
The task involves integrating the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token and the associated Splunk index name into our Logging Operator's deployment. The primary focus is on securely storing these credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and updating the Helm chartâ€™s values file to enable Splunk logging. IAM permissions are already configured and do not require updates. Once the changes are updated and merged into the Git repository, Argo CD, configured with ApplicationSets, will automatically detect and deploy the changes across the necessary environments.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Credentials Storage**: Store the Splunk HEC token and index name securely in AWS Secrets Manager, utilizing existing IAM permissions.
2. **Helm Chart Configuration**: Update the `values.yaml` file of the Helm chart to enable the Splunk output, ensuring that all necessary configurations are properly set.
3. **Git Operations**: Commit and merge the updated `values.yaml` file into the main branch of the repository.
4. **Automated Deployment**: Verify that once the changes are merged, Argo CD automatically picks up these changes and deploys them accordingly via the ApplicationSet.
5. **Documentation**: Document the process and configurations used, including how to activate the Splunk output and the operational flow with Argo CD.

### Task Breakdown:
- [ ] Securely store the Splunk HEC token and index name in AWS Secrets Manager.
- [ ] Update the `values.yaml` file to enable Splunk output, setting appropriate configurations.
- [ ] Merge changes into the Git repository to trigger automated deployments.
- [ ] Monitor the deployment process through Argo CD to ensure that the updates are applied successfully.
- [ ] Document the entire procedure, including storage, configuration, and deployment steps.
