### Bash Script for Initializing Project Structure

Save the following script as `init_flask_app.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the project directory name
PROJECT_DIR="flask_dynamic_secrets_app"

# Create the project directory and subdirectories
mkdir -p $PROJECT_DIR/templates

# Navigate into the project directory
cd $PROJECT_DIR

# Create Python script files
touch flask_secrets_watchdog.py config.py app.py secrets_loader.py requirements.txt

# Create the HTML template file
touch templates/index.html

# Populate requirements.txt with Flask, mysql-connector-python, and watchdog versions
echo "Flask==2.0.1
mysql-connector-python==8.0.23
watchdog==2.1.2" > requirements.txt

# Populate index.html with a basic HTML structure
echo "<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <title>Quotes</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <!-- Quotes will be inserted here -->
    </ul>
</body>
</html>" > templates/index.html

# Provide feedback that the script has finished
echo "Flask application structure initialized in $PROJECT_DIR"
```

### Instructions to Use the Script

1. **Make the Script Executable**: Before running the script, you need to grant it execute permissions. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `init_flask_app.sh`, and run:

```bash
chmod +x init_flask_app.sh
```

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running:

```bash
./init_flask_app.sh
```

This script will create the `flask_dynamic_secrets_app` directory with the specified structure and initial files. The `requirements.txt` file will be populated with specific versions of Flask, `mysql-connector-python`, and `watchdog`. The `index.html` file in the `templates` directory will contain a basic HTML structure to display quotes.

### Customizing the Script

- You can modify the script to include initial boilerplate code in `flask_secrets_watchdog.py`, `config.py`, `app.py`, and `secrets_loader.py` by adding `echo` commands similar to how `requirements.txt` and `index.html` are populated.
- For more complex projects or different languages, you can adapt this approach to scaffold out your project's initial structure, making project initialization more efficient.

This script provides a straightforward way to quickly set up your Flask project structure, allowing you to focus on developing the application's functionality.
